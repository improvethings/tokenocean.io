This is the repo for the tokenocean.io website. It uses Svelte and Tailwind.

## Dev commands
`npm install`
`npm run dev`
`npm run build`
`npm run start`
`npm run build:tailwind` (each time you add a new class, a class that does not exist in src/assets/styles/tailwind.css, you will need to run this command)
